We are thrilled to announce that Universities Studying Slavery (USS), thanks to the dedication and hard work of so many member institutions, has been recognized by the [Society of American Archivists (SAA)](https://www2.archivists.org/) for our collective “important work in providing a forum for academic institutions to critically examine their histories.” The organization presented USS with a resolution in our honor—terming USS “a vital hub for participating institutions to work together as they address both historical and contemporary issues dealing with race and inequality in higher education and in university communities”—you can read the resolution [here](https://www2.archivists.org/council/awards/2019/universities-studying-slavery).
University of Virginia President’s Commission on the University in the Age of Segregation (PCUAS) Program Officer Ashley Schmidt attended the SAA’s annual meeting in Austin, Texas, to receive the award. We are honored to accept and receive the award on the consortium’s behalf. We encourage everyone to keep up the great work!
