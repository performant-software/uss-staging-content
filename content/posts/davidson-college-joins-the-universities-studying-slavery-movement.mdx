Please Welcome Davidson College from North Carolina as the newest member of Universities Studying Slavery (USS). Davidson was founded in 1837 as a Presbyterian school in Davidson, North Carolina. Davidson College President Carol Quillen has created a team of faculty and archivists who have been at work researching Davidson's history with slavery and white supremacy.

The school won a Mellon Foundation Grant for "Justice, Equality, Community" that has helped them expand their efforts. Those efforts include a new graduation course requirement for all students by the same name, "Justice, Equality and Community." The Davidson College team is led by Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty Wendy Raymond and Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Byron McCrae.
