As the fall 2019 semester comes to a close, we have news from Universities Studying Slavery (USS) headquarters in Charlottesville. The USS consortium continues to expand. Today, we officially welcome the University of Georgia to the growing movement that spans the Atlantic Ocean and includes educational institutions in five countries. The University of Georgia is the fifty-seventh school to join the conversation.
The University of Georgia awarded a grant in November 2019 to a 22-member university academic team to study the history of slavery there. The research team includes membership from across the university. UGA Vice Provost for Diversity and Inclusion and Strategic University Initiatives said “We are excited to have a team of faculty from several units collaborating on this project. The range of expertise represented by the research team will provide a rich academic examination of the history of slavery at UGA and contribute significantly to our scholarly understanding of the history of the institution.”
The team is led by Chana Kai Lee, Associate Professor of History and African American Studies. You can read more about the new University of Georgia Project and see the complete team membership [here.](https://provost.uga.edu/uss/)
We hope everyone has a restful winter break and look forward to the continued growth of Universities Studying Slavery (USS) in 2020.
