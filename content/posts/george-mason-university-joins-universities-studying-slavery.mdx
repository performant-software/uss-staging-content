title: George Mason University Joins Universities Studying Slavery!

Universities Studying Slavery (USS), the consortium the President's Commission on Slavery and the University started in 2014-15 to create a collaborative network for schools seeking to examine their own histories of enslavement and racism, has grown over the past two years to include over thirty institutions in the United States, Canada, and Scotland. We are thrilled to see this become a movement and honored to work with and learn from so many other schools and scholars.

Today, this movement of colleges and universities confronting past entanglement in human bondage and racism has grown once more. George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, has signed on. GMU President Angel Cabrera accepted our invitation and has connected us to their ongoing research project, [Enslaved Children of George Mason](https://ecgm.omeka.net/). Dr. Wendi Manuel-Scott and Dr. Benedict Carlton are directors of the ECGM project and realize the vital importance of exploring the legacies of slavery, both on university campuses and in communities across the nation.

Please welcome George Mason University to Universities Studying Slavery.
