# Welcome to Universities Studying Slavery

Universities Studying Slavery (USS) is a consortium of over one hundred institutions of higher learning in the United States, Canada, Colombia, Scotland, Ireland, and England. These schools are focused on studying the historical connections between universities and slavery.

## Our Mission

The USS consortium works to:
- Research institutional histories related to slavery
- Share best practices for historical investigation
- Support memorialization and reconciliation efforts
- Engage with descendant communities
