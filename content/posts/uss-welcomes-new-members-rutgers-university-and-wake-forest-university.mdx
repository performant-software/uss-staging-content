Universities Studying Slavery (USS) is thrilled to continue its expansion in early 2017. Last year, we had a great year of expansion as American universities joined as they pursued their own histories. This past summer, the University of the South (Sewanee) joined, and this fall, Canadian Dalhousie University joined as their Lord Dalhousie Panel conducts research on slavery and race there.
As the new year rang in, several other institutions have reached out to us and we are now proud to welcome Wake Forest University and its History of Wake Forest University committee as they explore how to tell their institution's complicated antebellum story. Similarly, Rutgers University's Committee on Enslaved and Disenfranchised Populations in Rutgers History and its [Scarlet and Black Project](http://scarletandblack.rutgers.edu/) has signed up, bringing the number of institutional members working together to develop guiding principles and best practices for all other schools to twenty-three.
If your institution is interested in participating, please contact University of Virginia President's Commission on Slavery and the University (PCSU) Co-Chair Kirt von Daacke at kv2h@virginia.edu.
