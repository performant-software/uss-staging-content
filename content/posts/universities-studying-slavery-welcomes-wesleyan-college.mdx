Under the leadership of new President Vivia Fowler, [Wesleyan College](http://www.wesleyancollege.edu/) in Macon, Georgia, has joined the Universities Studying Slavery consortium. We are thrilled to add another school to this growing movement of institutions addressing past entanglement in human bondage or its post-emancipation legacies.
According to news reports, for more than a century, the nation's oldest college chartered for women-Wesleyan College-has had historical links to the Ku Klux Klan that had never been formally acknowledged. Its class names in 1909, 1913 and 1917 were the Ku Klux Klan. The 1913 yearbook is named the "Ku Klux" (Read more [here](http://www.myajc.com/news/state--regional/macon-women-college-seeks-atone-for-klux-klan-legacy/g7C2fxlEtmmV7ge4f7znCK/)). But that is changing now that former Wesleyan College Provost Vivia Fowler has become the school's president ([Inside HigherEd article](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/06/23/wesleyan-college-georgia-apologizes-decades-which-institution-embraced-ku-klux-klan)).
We welcome Wesleyan College, President Fowler, and her team to Universities Studying Slavery.
