Vanderbilt University has joined Universities Studying Slavery. The consortium has grown to over eighty schools in five countries. We are thrilled to have Vanderbilt join the conversation. As Vanderbilt Chancellor Daniel Diermeier noted, "Vanderbilt's membership in this consortium signals our dedication to a rigorous study of our institutional history. We recognize the importance of exploring and acknowledging the legacies of racial injustice and segregation through scholarship and rigorous research."

Vanderbilt faculty have already begun important research on the histories of enslavement and racial injustice, both at home in Nashville and globally. For instance, the [Slave Societies Digital Archive](https://slavesocieties.org/home) has preserved more than one million images of documents related to Africans and African-descended peoples in slave societies. As well, the [Historic Black Nashville Mapping Project](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/strategicplan/undergraduate-residential-education/universitycourses-2016-17/historic_black_nashville.php) to develop an online map of Historic Black Nashville.
