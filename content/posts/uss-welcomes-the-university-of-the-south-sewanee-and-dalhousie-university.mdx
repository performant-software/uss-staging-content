Universities Studying Slavery (USS) is thrilled to end 2016 on a high note. We've had a great year of expansion as American universities have joined as they pursue their own histories. This past summer, the University of the South (Sewanee) joined, and this fall, Canadian Dalhousie University joined as their Lord Dalhousie Panel conducts research on slavery and race in Dalhousie history. Very exciting to have USS expand beyond the United States-we are currently reaching out to institutions on both sides of the Atlantic!
