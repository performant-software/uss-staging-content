We thank the College of William & Mary and it's Lemon Project team for hosting Universities Studying Slavery as part of their annual Lemon Project Symposium March 14-16, 2019. The USS meeting will take place March 14 and the Lemon Project Symposium will take place March 15 and 16 at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. The theme of this year's conference is "Celebrating Legacies, Constructing Futures: Four Hundred Years of Black Community and Culture." This conference represents a great opportunity to connect with dozens of schools coming to terms with difficult pasts and also learn quite a bit from the many wonderful conference panels and presentations.
