The Universities Studying Slavery (USS) movement continues to grow. We are thrilled to announce that [The Citadel](http://www.citadel.edu/root/), the 175 year-old Military College of South Carolina, attended the UVA President's Commission on Slavery and the University Bicentennial symposium October 18-21, and has joined 31 other schools (in 3 countries and representing two continents) in the USS consortium. Citadel Provost Connie Ledoux Book accepted the invitation and shared this about the school's decision: "The Citadel's mission is to educate our students in a disciplined and intellectually challenging environment so that they develop into principled leaders instilled with our core values of honor, duty, and respect. Especially in these trying times here in the U.S. and societies around the world, we believe it necessary to renew our commitment to this position by joining the larger international movement of colleges and universities confronting past entanglements in human bondage and racism. The Citadel's founding is tied to slavery and, like the Universities Studying Slavery, we support the consortium's ongoing study of that history and its impact on our society today. Bo Moore, History Professor and Dean of the School of Humanities & Social Sciences, will lead the new Citadel History Project Task Force which will include members from the school's Diversity Equity and Inclusion Council, University Archivist, Tessa C. Updike, Associate Professor of History, Amanda R. Mushal, and Assistant Professor of History, Willie J. Griffin."

Please welcome The Citadel team. We look forward to your participation.
