It has been a busy week here at Universities Studying Slavery (USS) headquarters in Charlottesville, Virginia. Founded in 1775, [Hampden-Sydney College](http://www.hsc.edu/) is the 10th oldest college in the United States. A private college for men, it is the last American college founded in Colonial British America and sits near Farmville, Virginia. Hampden-Sydney College is known for its mission of forming "good men and good citizens," as well as its codes of honor and conduct, forty-year-old rhetoric program, liberal arts curriculum, and devoted alumni network.

The school has begun acknowledging its deep history with slavery, its aftermath in Prince Edward County and Virginia. The College will unite the work of history, art history, English, and religion professors and their students with primary source material collected, preserved, and interpreted by the Esther Thomas Atkinson Museum and the Walter M. Bortz Library.

We are heartened to see so many Virginia colleges and universities embark on this important process. Again, please welcome Hampden-Sydney College as the newest Universities Studying Slavery member.
