#### *Slavery, Reparations and Education: African Nova Scotia, Canada and Beyond*
#### Universities Studying Slavery 2021 Fall Symposium, October 21st-23rd, 2021, Dalhousie University and University of King’s College, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada
This will be the first USS conference held outside of the United States, the direct result of Dalhousie University and the University of King’s College being the first Canadian universities to formally investigate their historical links to slavery, leading to the [Report on Lord Dalhousie’s History on Slavery and Race and King’s and Slavery: A Scholarly Inquiry](https://www.dal.ca/dept/ldp/findings.html).
The conference presents the exciting opportunity to concretely explore the history(ies), impact(s) and legacy(ies) of slavery in Nova Scotia, Canada and the movement for reparations within the context of the Americas and the Black Atlantic. The long history of Black people in Canada has been profoundly shaped by slavery. Moreover, the special emphasis on slavery in Nova Scotia highlights not only the beginnings and roots of the Black presence and the institution and practice of slavery in Canada but the initiation and articulation of the process leading to the emergence of African Nova Scotians as a distinct people cum quasi-nation. Thus, in many ways, the African Nova Scotian experience represents a different narrative from those elaborated in previous USS conferences: one grounded in the local reality and interwoven with national, continental and global themes.
The conference encourages collaboration from scholars and activists – from the academy and the community - in order to promote dialogue, critical reflection and nuanced perspectives and a better understanding of the roles and legacies of slavery in the lives of people of African descent and their responses to addressing those roles and legacies, especially within Nova Scotia and Canada. Thus, the conference will directly engage with slavery’s complicated legacies. Among the pressing contemporary issues are reparations, reparative justice, the African Nova Scotian struggle for self-determination, anti-Black racism, discrimination and inequity within academe and battles to rename places and spaces. A key focus will be slavery’s legacy in the institutions of higher education and how the history of enslavement is manifested in the development of universities Canada and the United States. The conference will provide a venue and space for these very important conversations, discussions and debates.
The conference will be held over three days, with one day fully dedicated to the African Nova Scotian experience. The rest of the conference will explore and interweave the wider and intersecting themes and discussions, including the African Nova Scotia narrative. Conference organizers welcome papers from an array of disciplines using a variety of theoretical frameworks and methodologies. Disciplinary contributions are encouraged from, inter alia, but not limited to history, anthropology, archeology,criminology, sociology, literature, music, political science. We also encourage and welcome input and abstracts from activists, community practitioners and community. Practitioners in cultural history institutions, and the visual and performing arts, are also encouraged to submit, as non-traditional and/or alternative forms of presenting research, e.g. in videos, visual art or performances, will be supported.
In addition to individual paper proposals, participants are encouraged to submit proposals for panels. Panels can be disciplinary, multi-disciplinary or consist of academics and non-academics. Panels may consist of three to four papers/presentations addressing a coherent theme or issue. The organizing committee reserves the right to make changes in the overall configuration of panels.
