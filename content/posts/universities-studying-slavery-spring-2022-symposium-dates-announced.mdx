Save the date! Plan to join host institutions Guilford College and Wake Forest University for the Spring 2022 Universities Studying Slavery (USS) Symposium in Greensboro and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Day one will be held in Greensboro and Day two will be in Winston-Salem. The conference will feature tours of historic sites in the region, including the [Old Salem’s Hidden Town Project](https://www.oldsalem.org/core-initiatives/hidden-town-project/), [Salem College and Academy](https://www.salem.edu/),  the [International Civil Rights Museum](https://www.sitinmovement.org/), and the [Black is Beautiful exhibit](https://reynolda.org/museum/exhibitions/black-is-beautiful-the-photography-of-kwame-brathwaite/) at Reynolda House. The hosts anticipate that this will be primarily an in-person meeting with some hybrid and virtual events, however, they will be assessing the COVID situation and make changes accordingly. Please continue to check the [event website](https://cvent.me/WYaRWn) for updates and information.
Anticipated themes include:
- In what ways are local communities partnering with public and historic sites?
- New methods for teaching hard histories
- Universities engaging communities around slavery
- The legacy of slavery and the politics of philanthropy
**Guilford College and Wake Forest University look forward to welcoming you to the Triad!**
