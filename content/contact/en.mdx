### Seeking Guidance, Have Questions, or Interested in Joining USS?

Universities Studying Slavery (USS) welcomes any school seeking guidance or hoping to join the consortium. USS membership is primarily institutional: schools that have launched truth-seeking research and education projects. However, we also welcome queries and participation from individual scholars as well. 

The USS team also provides consulting services to any school or team seeking to launch their own project.

If your institution has released or published a report, or if you have a sample syllabus or class project, please share it with us and we will add it to the USS Library.
