      Collaboration, Research, and Education in Search of More Inclusive
      Histories
    description: >-
      The Universities Studying Slavery (USS) consortium was created in 2016 by
      UVA both to ensure that UVA's important work would spread beyond Virginia
      and to respond to calls for guidance from other schools. Today, it
      includes over one hundred institutions—independent schools, liberal arts
      colleges, community colleges, regional universities, and large research
      universities—from across the globe researching their own historical ties
      to slavery, segregation, and their legacies. Together, these schools are
      focused on sharing guiding principles and best practices as they engage in
      research-based educational projects including on human bondage, land
      dispossession, and more broadly, racism in their histories.

  - title: Genesis of USS
    description: >-
      In 2015, the University of Virginia President’s Commission on Slavery and
      the University (PCSU) launched “Virginia’s Colleges and Universities
      Studying Slavery (VCUSS),” an informal working group dedicated to
      collaboration between Virginia schools as they examined histories of
      enslavement. That working group initially included UVA and four other
      Virginia schools. Within just a few months, six other Virginia schools had
      joined.


      In December 2015, after a teach-in at Georgetown University, UVA decided
      to expand, renaming VCUSS as “Universities Studying Slavery (USS)” after
      Georgetown joined. Since 2016, USS has worked to ensure that UVA's
      important work would spread beyond Virginia, providing guidance to any
      institution that sought its help. Today, USS now includes over one hundred
      schools across the globe.
