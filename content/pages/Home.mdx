      Collaboration, Research, and Education in Search of More Inclusive
      Histories
    description: >-
      The Universities Studying Slavery (USS) consortium was created in 2016 by
      UVA both to ensure that UVA's important work would spread beyond Virginia
      and to respond to calls for guidance from other schools. Today, it
      includes over one hundred institutions—independent schools, liberal arts
      colleges, community colleges, regional universities, and large research
      universities—from across the globe researching their own historical ties
      to slavery, segregation, and their legacies. Together, these schools are
      focused on sharing guiding principles and best practices as they engage in
      research-based educational projects including on human bondage, land
      dispossession, and more broadly, racism in their histories.
