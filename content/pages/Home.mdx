              ## Collaboration, Research, and Education in Search of More
              Inclusive Histories


              The Universities Studying Slavery (USS) consortium was created in
              2016 by UVA both to ensure that UVA's important work would spread
              beyond Virginia and to respond to calls for guidance from other
              schools. Today, it includes over one hundred
              institutions—independent schools, liberal arts colleges, community
              colleges, regional universities, and large research
              universities—from across the globe researching their own
              historical ties to slavery, segregation, and their legacies.
              Together, these schools are focused on sharing guiding principles
              and best practices as they engage in research-based educational
              projects including on human bondage, land dispossession, and more
              broadly, racism in their histories.

              ## Genesis of USS


              In 2015, the University of Virginia President’s Commission on
              Slavery and the University (PCSU) launched “Virginia’s Colleges
              and Universities Studying Slavery (VCUSS),” an informal working
              group dedicated to collaboration between Virginia schools as they
              examined histories of enslavement. That working group initially
              included UVA and four other Virginia schools. Within just a few
              months, six other Virginia schools had joined.


              In December 2015, after a teach-in at Georgetown University, UVA
              decided to expand, renaming VCUSS as “Universities Studying
              Slavery (USS)” after Georgetown joined. Since 2016, USS has worked
              to ensure that UVA's important work would spread beyond Virginia,
              providing guidance to any institution that sought its help. Today,
              USS now includes over one hundred schools across the globe.

              Since Brown University’s 2006 Slavery and Justice Report, an
              entire field of study has developed. Here, we provide links to
              scholarly monographs and edited volumes, as well as a host of
              downloadable institutional research reports, brochures, walking
              tours, sample class projects, and syllabi.
