USS membership is primarily institutional: schools that have launched truth-seeking research and education projects. However, we also welcome queries and participation from individual scholars as well.\_\n\nThe USS team also provides consulting services to any school or team seeking to launch their own project.\n\nIf your institution has released or published a report, or if you have a sample syllabus or class project, please share it with us and we will add it to the USS Library.\_\n"
